# Instructions to replicate the results

# (1) Replicating the results of experiment 2 (seperaete classifier at each level)

For model training: Run USE_USE/Model_training_USE_USE.py'

Github only allows files upto 100 MB to be uploaded. So I can't upload the models. Clone this repo and Run the above mentioned file the models will be automatically saved. Training might take some time.

For model Testing : Run USE_USE/Model_testing_USE_USE.py 

I have also made a Flask API run USE_USE/Flask.py and then run api.py to hit the API.


# (2) Replicating the results of experiment 3 (Combination of flat and Node based classifier[Best results])

For model training: TF_TF_NODE_based/train.py'

Github only allows files upto 100 MB to be uploaded. So I can't upload the models. Clone this repo and Run the above mentioned file the models will be automatically saved. Training might take some time.

For Testing on a single example:TF_TF_NODE_based/test.py'

To run using Flask API: Run the TF_TF_NODE_based/Flask.py file and then run TF_TF_NODE_based/api.py
