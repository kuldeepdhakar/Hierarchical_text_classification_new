For model training: Run USE_USE/Model_training_USE_USE'

Github only allows files upto 100 MB to be uploaded. SO I can't upload the models. Clone this repo and Run the above mentioned file the models will be automatically saved. Training might take some time.

For model Testing : Run USE_USE/Model_testing_USE_USE 

I have also made a Flask API run USE_USE/Flask.py and then run api.py to hit the API.
